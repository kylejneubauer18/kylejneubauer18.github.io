## Right Knowlege, Right Environment, and Right Professor

<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When registering and reading the course catalog about softeare engineering, each person will create an idea of what the course would entail and some worries on what to expect. I for one when I signed up for the software engineering course, I had created in my mind some thoughts on what the course could be about and naturally I was a little worried. I went into the course assuming that it will be another course that is code intensive, and for the first few weeks my assumptions were correct. We were coding using if statements, I remember having to do Fibonacci numbers, and i'm liking thinking "alright here we go". However, as the the course continued and everyone was starting to get into the groove of things, it started to get easier. The modules were setup as to build one on top of the other and you start learning things and getting excited for thing and it became more enjoyable. You start to learn about development environments, coding standard, agile project mangagements, and a slew of other relevant things all related to softwarere enginerring as a whole without you even realizing that you were learning an indepth subject, which made it so enjoyable. I truly believe that it had to do with how the material is laid out for you to be able to aborb all the knowledge you were taking in, the environment into which you are learning, and of course the professor to chart the course. Software engineering in general is a multifaceted subject.
