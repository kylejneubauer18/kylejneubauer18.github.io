## Right Knowledge, Right Environment, and Right Professor

<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When registering and reading the course catalog about software engineering, each person will create an idea of what the course would entail and some worries on what to expect. I for one, when I signed up for the software engineering course had created in my mind some thoughts on what the course could be about and naturally I was a little worried. I went into the course assuming that it will be another course that is code intensive, and for the first few weeks my assumptions were correct. We were coding using "if" statements, I even remember having to do Fibonacci numbers, and I'm like thinking "alright here we go, it's about to get intense". However, as the course continued and everyone started to get into the groove of things, it started to get easier. Don't get me wrong the course still involved coding and a lot of it most of the time on many different pages, but I can attest that it wasn't at all bad. Granted there were a lot of new things to learn also, but we will get to that a little later.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modules were set up to build one on top of the other and you start learning things and getting excited for things and it became more enjoyable to me. You start to learn about development environments, coding standards, agile project managements, and a slew of other relevant things all related to software engineering as a whole, without you even realizing that you were learning an in-depth subject, which made it so enjoyable. I truly believe that what contributed to the enjoyment about learning software engineering in general had to do with how the material is laid out for you to be able to absorb all the knowledge you were taking in, the environment into which you are learning, and of course the professor to chart the course. Software engineering in general is a multifaceted subject and could  on some occasions seem overwhelming but given the right knowledge, right environment, and right professor it becomes something you love to do.

## Software Engineering Uses Many Different Environments

<div align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software engineering uses many different versions of development environments. First, a development environment is an integrated development environment, which is a software development tool the has the following properties:
  
* Language-aware editing
* Project definition facilities
* Integrated compilation
* Integrated stepwise execution

in other words an IDE is where a software engineer will do the majority of their work when it relates to the creation or edits of a software program.<br><br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a software engineer you will encounter many many many different environments way before you even graduate. The way a software engineer decides on which environment to work with comes down to a few factors. The engineer may have encountered a particular environment based on the preference of a professor, the type of job they are working on, or just personal preferences. Not all IDEs are created equally so when it boils down to it, we tend to stick to what we know and what we know is the easiest. For example, I have been introduced to many different IDEs through out my career in school and sometimes I have to work with IDEs because that is the only available IDE there is for a job to get done, other times i'm introduced to a environment because that is the preference of the instructor to help even out the playing fields in terms of other student experiences. I don't mind working in any environments, to me it helps me be a better software engineer and allows me to be more marketable because I have gained experiences in many different forms of IDEs compared to someone who hasn't.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visual studios is my preferred language to code in, till this day I remember how I was introduced to it. We were in a lab class and I couldn't figure out and was not mentally prepared to work and code in a terminal, for some reason my head just could not wrap around the idea that to compile a code and to link a code I would need to enter a super long command line prompt, I was in shock that there wasn't a magic button in where i would click it and it would do all the work for me in the background, little did I know that the single button was technically doing the same thing. My lab partner noticed how much I was struggling in working within the terminal environment and using VI as my editor. That is when he introduced me to Visual Studios, he showed me very quickly how to work around it and do the work that needed to be done and not have to rely heavily on the terminal. It was heaven and it made my life much better. In the beginning it was rough but I stuck through it because I didn't want to go back to the alternative and work in a terminal environment again. However, here we are years later and it's still my preferred choice of development environment because I understand it and I'm comfortable with it.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everytime I have to work in a different environment I would first check to see if I could do my work within Visual studios and if I couldn't that is when I would work in another environment, I'm not totally closed off to other environments just because I have a preference. I completely understand that there will just be instances in which Visual Studios just can not work and I'm ok with that.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A development environment goes beyond web development. I feel like a web development environment such as the use of JSfiddle and intelliJ is part of a small picture that helps build a bigger picture. A development environment even goes beyond the use of IDEs, to be a development environment, is an environment that you work in that will allow you to get to your full potential and nudges you in the write direction if you have any errors. Lastly, a development environment is an environment (to me) that you are most comfortable working in.

## Coding Standards, its not just an Option, but the Rule of the Land
