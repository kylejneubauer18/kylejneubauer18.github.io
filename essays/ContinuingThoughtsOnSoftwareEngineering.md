## Right Knowledge, Right Environment, and Right Professor

<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When registering and reading the course catalog about software engineering, each person will create an idea of what the course would entail and some worries on what to expect. I for one, when I signed up for the software engineering course had created in my mind some thoughts on what the course could be about and naturally I was a little worried. I went into the course assuming that it will be another course that is code intensive, and for the first few weeks my assumptions were correct. We were coding using "if" statements, I even remember having to do Fibonacci numbers, and i'm liking thinking "alright here we go, it's about to get intense". However, as the the course continued and everyone started to get into the groove of things, it started to get easier. Don't get me wrong the course still involved coding and a lot of it most of the time on many different pages, but I can attest that it wasn't at all bad. Granted there were a lot of new things to learning also, but we will get to that a little later.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modules were setup as to build one on top of the other and you start learning things and getting excited for things and it became more enjoyable. You start to learn about development environments, coding standard, agile project managements, and a slew of other relevant things all related to software engineering as a whole, without you even realizing that you were learning an in-depth subject, which made it so enjoyable. I truly believe that what contributed to the enjoyment about learning software engineering in general had to do with how the material is laid out for you to be able to absorb all the knowledge you were taking in, the environment into which you are learning, and of course the professor to chart the course. Software engineering in general is a multifaceted subject an could  on some occasions seem overwhelming.
