## Before There Was A U and I
The Problem:
As an engineering student be that as a civil, mechanical, electrical, or computer engineering student,
one of the requirements for graduating is that a student needs to take a sophomore, junior, and senior project class to be able to graduate.
The theory behind the project class and to which I agree too is to help the student apply what they so far have learned in their engineering
curriculum and apply that knowledge in a real world situation. The problem is the projects are not always CLEARLY and READILY available to the student.
I for one was super confused on where to find these information when it was time to register. These project classes aren't one of those classes where
you can log on to the campus class availability and find the CRN and register. The student would need to ask around campus and professors if they have
any project classes and if the student is interested in joining the project class, the student would then email the professor asking for the project specific CRN.
Then and only then the student can register for the class.
