## Overviwe
<p>The Problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an engineering student be that as a civil, mechanical, electrical, or computer engineering student,
one of the requirements for graduating is that a student needs to take a sophomore, junior, and senior project class to be able to graduate.
The theory behind the project class and to which I agree too is to help the student apply what they so far have learned in their engineering
curriculum and apply that knowledge in a real world situation. The problem is the projects are not always CLEARLY and READILY available to the student.
I for one was super confused on where to find these information when it was time to register. These project classes aren't one of those classes where
you can log on to the campus class availability and find the CRN and register. The student would need to ask around campus and professors if they have
any project classes and if the student is interested in joining the project class, the student would then email the professor asking for the project specific CRN.Then and only then the student can register for the class.</p>
<p> The Solution</P>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A centeralized website where all availabile projects is listed and the projects would then be separated depending on the field of study. If a project course should have multiple opprutunities in different fields then the project course would be listed in each field. The centeral website could then be linked and placed within the University of Hawaii Course Catalog Online, Class Avalability, and the college of engineering website to make it easily accessable to the student
</p>  

## Mockup Page Ideas
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The website would be organized with a college of engineering banner at the top left of the page and a navigation bar that is then broken down to each engineering dicipline with the option to login using the students email address making it esier for the student to reach out to the project course instructor. The central page would display important messages and a centeral picture foucusing on projects currently being held, and lastly a footer menu at the bottom of the site. By clicking on the desired engineering tab, a new page would open up and show the student a card type look of all the available projects for that particular dicipline and if a user clicks on a project if would immidiately first display the class standing the project is available to be it sophomore, junior, senior and a brief introduction to the project.
