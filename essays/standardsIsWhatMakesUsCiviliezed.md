## In The Past
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may not realize this but we live in a world full of standards. It's just a matter of interpretation and how that person views it as a standard. Standard is defined as ":something established by authority, custom, or general consent as a model or example" according to Merriam-Webster dictionary. With that being said let's take a little trip down history. At the birth of the United States our founding fathers wanted to differentiate themselves from the United Kingdom. The Constitution was created as the standard of our young Nation and sets up a law that every citizens of the United States will always have freedoms in place that the government can not touch. Such freedoms consists of the usual suspects such as freedom of speech, freedom to own property, freedom to openly practice religion of the citizens choosing, and so forth. As new nations developed around the world, the constitution became and or is preceived as the standard of how their new country will be. For example, Mynamar who until 2011 was ruled by the military and finally adopted a democractic government which was loosly based on the United States Constitution.<br /></p>
