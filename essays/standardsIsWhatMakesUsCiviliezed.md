## Standards Are The Peoples Code
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may not realize this but we live in a world full of standards. It's just a matter of interpretation and how that person views it as a standard. Standard is defined as ":something established by authority, custom, or general consent as a model or example" according to Merriam-Webster dictionary. With that being said let's take a little trip down history. At the birth of the United States our founding fathers wanted to differentiate themselves from the United Kingdom when drafting the law of the land of our young nation. The birth of the Constitution was created as the standard of our young Nation and sets up a law that every citizens of the United States will always have freedoms in place that the government can not touch. Such freedoms consists of the usual suspects such as freedom of speech, freedom to own property, freedom to openly practice religion of the citizens choosing, and so forth which surely will differentiaite itself from The United Kingdom. As new nations developed around the world, the constitution became and/or is preceived as the standard of how their new country will be. For example, Mynamar who until 2011 was ruled by the military and finally adopted a democractic government which was loosly based on the United States Constitution.<br /></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A standard will always be needed even if some people will not agree to it. Just like our government we all adopt a majority rules mentality and fair is fair. Having placed a standard in our day to day life keeps us from chaos and helps restraint our possible animalistic tendances. For exmple, having a standard such as our consitution differentiates of from the animal kingdom, even the holy bible is a form of code of conduct which is also a standard in a spiritual sense. We as people in some form acknowledge that our actions needs to be guided and restrained because it we can't govern ourselves or compose ourself properly we will be no different from the animals. For example, a seaturtle who once she lays her eggs will go back to the ocean and will never see her childeren or even recognize them once they give birth or like a shark who is not ashamed of eating its own kind. For us seeing things, like how a seaturtle will treat her youngs or seeing a shark eating its own kind as barbaric and cruel to them its just a matter of nature. Without the standards we place on our soceity we would not be where we are today.<br /></p>
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many other examples of how standards is our soceities unwritten code, be it a code of law, code of conduct, or a personal standard that you placed on yourself. For example, just with school you may have set a standard that you will not get any B's this semester. Again to reiterate what I mentioned above, there are many more examples of how standards is the unwritten code our our soceity which is only proper to also have a standard when coding. I maybe too young to remember this but when coding started to become mainstream many companies wanted to cash in on programming and with each company they set their own standards. However, they did not realize there was one to many cooks in the kitchen, and of course programmers would eventually perfer one company over the other and as time passes a standard started forming. I for one prefer to have a coding standard, reason being is that when I look at another persons code the structure of the code will be simililar to mines and I will not have to ask that person too many questions. Also when coding having standards in placed makes a programmers code look more crisp, clean, and organized. Knowing what I know that we live in a soceity of standards adding a coding standard is no problem for me, I live it everyday and having a coding standard is just another one to add to that list and will allow me to be a civilized human being.<br /></p>
