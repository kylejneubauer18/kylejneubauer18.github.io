## The Art In Questions
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had my eyes recently opened in asking the smart and right way of asking questions, and it was a real eye opener for me. At work, during training, each new employee would have to take a training course on how to ask proper question. Asking a question is a two-way conversation, for example, if a customer had come in and asked “my phone is broken” you would automatically in your mind consider that a dumb question. That question/statement does not help the person asking or myself from helping one another get to a solution, if anything if would take longer to get there because I would have to put on my detective hat ask a few more questions to help narrow down the issue.<br /></p>
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working in tech especially in the troubleshooting aspect of tech, I know how to ask questions when it’s time for me to get an issue resolved. For example, recently I had gotten a new phone and as soon as I booted up my phone, I get an alert that my device wasn’t activated. The tech support in me kicked into high gear. My first instinct is to wait a few more moments to see if the device will automatically try to reconnect with the network, after a few moments I got the same activation error. My next Instinct was to reboot my device, failed again, my next instinct was to pop out the sim try to no avail. I put the device in airplane mode and turned it off, still nothing. I jumped on googled to see if there were any known issues or any fixes for my issues, nothing, which would make sense because the phone has only been out for a few months. After trying all those trouble shooting techniques and still could resolve my issues. This is the part where I relented and finally decided to call into my carrier to seek some help.<br /></p>
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once I got on the phone with them, they would ask me as I’m sure they ask everyone “How they could help me out today”. I would then reply with “Well I just got a new phone today, and when I booted up my phone and was going through the setup process, I received an alert on my device, stating that activation failed. I was just calling to see if there was any way you would be able to help me fix my issue?”, I would then explain to the representative all of the steps that I have taken on my own to try to resolve it.<br /></p>
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking a question like “My Phone is broken; can you help me?” doesn’t really help the person who is trying to help. The person needing help didn’t really give any information on what caused the issue in the first place or any steps they have done to try to resolve their issue. However, if the same person came in and rephrased their question by “I keep getting this alert on my phone that my phone hasn’t been backed up in XxX days and I’ve searched the web to see if I could find a solution but really couldn’t find anything near to the issue that I’m having, I was wonder if you would know anything and if you could help me out?” would be a better question because the person stated the exact issue they were having and what they have done to try to resolve the issue themselves, which saves the person helping them a step cause they know they will no longer have to search the web and is able to find a solution elsewhere.<br /></p>
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking smart questions in software engineering is important for both parties because the common denominator in this, is time. If a person isn’t asking the right questions, they are wasting the time of the person who is trying to help them out and end up doing wasting more of their time because no one would want to help them because they have gained the reputation of asking dumb questions.<br /></p>

## To Question Or Not To Question A Hacker
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A post from [John](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6524329/john) would be considered a smart question. His Subject line is directly connected to his question. The subject line states, “The entitlements in your app bundle signature do not match the ones that are contained in the provisioning profile” and the body of his question shows the code error he is exactly doing and in bullet steps he has done on his own to help him find a resolution to his problem. Such steps he has taken is cleaning up his project, re-enabling automatic app signing in XCODE, deleting his provisioning files (file pathway included), and so forth. The thing that takes John’s smart question a step further is he has included updates to his question body as time passes, to keep the readers informed on the status of his update.<br /></p>
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A post from Ryanv048 (yes this is me asking a question before being aware of proper smart question etiquette) would be a good example of a question that did not fulfill a good chunk from Raimonds’ post. The subject line had a word mis-spelled, however, had a concise and straight to the point question. The body of the question could have gone better. The poster just stated the question he was asking and did not go any further into detail on his question. The poster failed to include and relevant codes nor any steps he has taken to help himself. Overall, the body of his post is a single line.<br /></p>
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently John’s post garnered over 1000 views with a single to the point answer, although, he only received a signle answer it was an answer directly releated to his question without any extra jargon. IN regards, to John receving a single answer the famous saying "Its about quality not quantity" that prevailed. On the otherhand, Ryanv048’s post garnered a lousy 192 view and was closed my moderators for lacking to add details and clarity to the problem.<br /></p>
