## Before There Was A U and I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before there was a Semantic UI there was Twitter Bootstrap, twitter bootstrap was launched in August of 2011 and created by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter offices, while the latter Semantic UI launched in September of 2013 and created by Jack Lukic. The goal of bootstrap was to save time for web developers while ensuring that the website maintained a similar style across all sites. Some of the most well known websites use bootstrap and those websites include Netflix, CNN.com, and Espn.com to name a few. Bootstrap has a very large community of developers who use it according to developerz.software towards the end of 2020 there were about 100,000 questions on StackOverflow with a hashtag of twitter-bootstrap and out of those one-hundred thousand 70% is showing to have been resolved.

Right after the launch of Semantic UI the amount of developers using Semantic UI is farless then the amount of developers using bootstrap.
