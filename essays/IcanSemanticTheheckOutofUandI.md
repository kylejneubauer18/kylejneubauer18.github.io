## Before There Was A U and I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before there was a Semantic UI there was Twitter Bootstrap, twitter bootstrap was launched in August of 2011 and created by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter offices, while the latter Semantic UI launched in September of 2013 and created by Jack Lukic. The goal of bootstrap was to save time for web developers while ensuring that the website maintained a similar style across all sites. Some of the most well known websites use bootstrap and those websites include Netflix, CNN.com, and Espn.com to name a few. Bootstrap has a very large community of developers who use it according to developerz.software towards the end of 2020 there were about 100,000 questions on StackOverflow with a hashtag of twitter-bootstrap and out of those one-hundred thousand 70% is showing to have been resolved. You can read more about it [here](https://developerz.software/2020/03/29/semantic-ui-or-bootstrap-discover-the-pros-and-cons-of-each-framework/).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast Semantic UI was created out of the idea that the framework of CSS should be based on natural human language. Right after the launch of Semantic UI the amount of developers using Semantic UI is farless then the amount of developers using bootstrap. However, according to deceloperz.software in 2015 the community for Semantic UI managed to grow exponentially the community managed to create some 3,000 themes for the framwork, 50 components for the user-interface, and carried out 3,800 commits on GitHub. With the popularity of Semantic UI there has been more and more websites using the framwork some well know websites that uses Semantic UI are SnapChat a social media app that competes with the likes of Instagram and TikTok, another well know company that uses Semantic UI is Accenture, accodring to [newsroom](https://newsroom.accenture.com/fact-sheet/) accenture is a global professional services company with leading capabilities in digital, cloud, and security. They offer an unmatched experience and speacilized skills across more than 40 industires and offer Strategy and Consulting, Interactive, technology and operations which is all powered by the wolrd's largest network of Advanced Technology and Intelligent Operations centers.
 
## The Good And The Bad
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the many reasons as to why Semantic UI has grown exponentially since its inception is the easy of use of the framework and how intuitive it is. For example, I had a chance to create three text columns using just css alone, and I have to admit it was really difficult. There was alot of playing around with the margins, padding, and position of the text paragraph. Even then I still couldn't get it to work properly when adjusting the size of the screen my alignment would get thrown off. However, once I used the same three column text paragraph using Semantic UI and I absolutely loved it. The framework automatically aligned the columns and when adjusting the screen size it auto-adjusted to fit. I have to admit after that I was blown away because in css it took more lines of code to get it partially working whereas in Semantic UI it took far less amount of code.</p>
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other things that makes Semantic UI more more of a dream to use things that make Semantic UI more efficient is the amount of time a delveloper will save in designing a website. As mentioned about there are currently about 3,000 or so themes to use within Semantic UI even the default themes will suffice in creating an asthetically pleasing website. Whereas, in Bootstrap, the developer would have to create their own within the CSS environment which will take time in adjusting the proper placement of every element of the website.</p>
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Semantic UI and Bootstrap is definetly not without any faults quite the opposite as discussed above Bootstrap alone has had 100,000 questions asked on Stack Overflow and Semantic UI also has queitons. Some problems that plague Semantice UI is browser compatibility, less responsive design, smaller community compared to Bootstrap, and very few updates. On the otherhand Bootstrap is plauged by having to create your own layout if you do not agree to the predefined ones in the framework, and CSS files can get pretty large. In time i'm sure that both frameworks will evenutally equal out and new updates will fix current angst in the frameworks.</p>
