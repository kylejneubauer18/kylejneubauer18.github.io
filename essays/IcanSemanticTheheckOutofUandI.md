## Before There Was A U and I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before there was a Semantic UI there was Twitter Bootstrap, twitter bootstrap was launched in August of 2011 and created by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter offices, while the latter Semantic UI launched in September of 2013 and created by Jack Lukic. The goal of bootstrap was to save time for web developers while ensuring that the website maintained a similar style across all sites. Some of the most well known websites use bootstrap and those websites include Netflix, CNN.com, and Espn.com to name a few. Bootstrap has a very large community of developers who use it according to developerz.software towards the end of 2020 there were about 100,000 questions on StackOverflow with a hashtag of twitter-bootstrap and out of those one-hundred thousand 70% is showing to have been resolved. You can read more about it [here](https://developerz.software/2020/03/29/semantic-ui-or-bootstrap-discover-the-pros-and-cons-of-each-framework/).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast Semantic UI was created out of the idea that the framework of CSS should be based on natural human language. Right after the launch of Semantic UI the amount of developers using Semantic UI is farless than the amount of developers using bootstrap. However, according to deceloperz.software in 2015 the community for Semantic UI managed to grow exponentially the community managed to create some 3,000 themes for the framework, 50 components for the user-interface, and carried out 3,800 commits on GitHub. With the popularity of Semantic UI there has been more and more websites using the framework some well known websites that uses Semantic UI are SnapChat a social media app that competes with the likes of Instagram and TikTok, another well know company that uses Semantic UI is Accenture, according to [newsroom](https://newsroom.accenture.com/fact-sheet/) accenture is a global professional services company with leading capabilities in digital, cloud, and security. They offer an unmatched experience and specialized skills across more than 40 industries and offer Strategy and Consulting, Interactive, technology and operations which is all powered by the world's largest network of Advanced Technology and Intelligent Operations centers.
 
## The Good And The Bad
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the many reasons as to why Semantic UI has grown exponentially since its inception is the easy of use of the framework and how intuitive it is. For example, I had a chance to create three text columns using just css alone, and I have to admit it was really difficult. There was a lot of playing around with the margins, padding, and position of the text paragraph. Even then I still couldn't get it to work properly when adjusting the size of the screen my alignment would get thrown off. However, once I used the same three column text paragraph using Semantic UI and I absolutely loved it. The framework automatically aligned the columns and when adjusting the screen size it auto-adjusted to fit. I have to admit after that I was blown away because in css it took more lines of code to get it partially working whereas in Semantic UI it took far less amount of code.</p>
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other things that make Semantic UI more of a dream to use things that make Semantic UI more efficient is the amount of time a developer will save in designing a website. As mentioned there are currently about 3,000 or so themes to use within Semantic UI even the default themes will suffice in creating an aesthetically pleasing website. Whereas, in Bootstrap, the developer would have to create their own within the CSS environment which will take time in adjusting the proper placement of every element of the website.</p>
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Semantic UI and Bootstrap is definitely not without any faults quite the opposite as discussed above Bootstrap alone has had 100,000 questions asked on Stack Overflow and Semantic UI also has questions. Some problems that plague Semantic UI are browser compatibility, less responsive design, smaller community compared to Bootstrap, and very few updates. On the other hand Bootstrap is plagued by having to create your own layout if you do not agree to the predefined ones in the framework, and CSS files can get pretty large. In time i'm sure that both frameworks will eventually equal out and new updates will fix current angst in the frameworks.</p>

## From The Outside Looking In
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first started using semantic UI I loved it and I still loved it. However, As time passed I personally started getting confused myself. I think it's just one of those pains when learning anything new. The things where I found myself tripping up on is there are one to many divs to use and the placement of those divs. For example, recently I was tinkering around with Semantic UI on a website that I was trying to recreate. I was trying to separate my code in rows and I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to get my rows horizontally, my navbar kept coming out as vertical turns out my version of row and Semantic UI version of rows are completely different. Once I was able to figure it out  I was finally able to get it to work. Another confusion on my part is when and why would you still want to use css style and not the themes built into semantic and what makes them different. Sometimes, when i'm recreating a website I find myself using both Semantic UI and just css alone. I guess for me it works out as long as the webpage looks like the webpage that i am trying to re-creating. With that being said, I can totally understand why people would say UI frameworks aren't as simple and could be as complicated as learning a new programming language. I agree that using and experiencing UI frameworks is exactly like learning a new programing language, but then again with learning something new there will always be a curve but i'm sure if the developer commits themselves to practicing they will eventually get the hang of the framework and will be well on their way to creating aesthetically pleasing website.</p>
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have experienced working with bootcamp or strictly have been working within style .css files you know how cumbersome it can get when you have to create and sectionalize bits and pieces of the website you're working on. Having to work with style .css alone you would be creating your own rows and classes for specific parts of the website such as the menu bar or a color block. Why waste all that time when you have a framework with those classes already made and it's just a matter of picking and using the right class that will work for your website you're trying to create. Therefore, working and learning Semantic UI will save you many hours of aggravation and frustrations because Semantic UI will have classes already made and its just a matter of implementing it within your code.  </p>
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, no matter what your reason is to use a framework, each developer will have their own preferences on which they prefer to use be it Twitter Bootstrap or Semantic UI or even straight to the point style .css. I feel that preference will come in the form on how that developer learned how to code. For example, I tend to stick to what I know and try not to learn anything new because I don't have the time to learn it, however, if it's required to learn in school or even work I will definitely take the time to learn it. I got lucky because the school I come from requires each student to learn many languages throughout your time in school. Even better sometimes you get lucky where a professor will teach you more than one language. I truly believe that a developer is in a better position if they are at least aware of and have dipped their feet in other languages. To me so far a mixture of both using Semantic UI and style .css has worked out quite well for me. I'm creating better websites with Semantic UI because of its themes and using style .css if the theme in Semantic UI isn't up to my standards when building a website.</p>
