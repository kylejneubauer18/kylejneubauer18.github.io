## A Look Into The Past
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever asked someone how they ended up doing what they’re doing for a living and they reply with “I just kind of fell into it”? Growing up I’ve heard that line more than a handful of times and never could quiet understand or wrap my head around how can someone just fall into a job, that they may or may not even like. A follow-up question that I usually ask after hearing that said line is “do you enjoy your job?” more often than not the reply is usually a resounding “yes”, which to me is even more mind blowing.<br /></p>
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might ask yourself “what was the point of that?”, well the point is, that is how I found myself in the field of software engineering. The younger version of me was wide eyed and full of dreams, out of high school I wanted to get into corporate law, because at the time in the news Abercrombie and Fitch were discriminating against people who did not see them a fit for their brand and I wanted to stand up for those people because that wasn’t right. However, I started taking class related to law and it was just not that entertaining to me. After Law, I decided to dip my feet in engineering, at first, I found it very interesting because I know for a fact that the world would not be where we are right now without engineers, then the math came, and I wasn’t prepared for it and really hated math (I don’t anymore) and I decided to drop out. I asked myself if I’m really ready for a lifetime of doing math and I came to the conclusion that I wasn’t, so I left school for a few years and worked random jobs and hung out with my friends and just enjoyed life.<br /></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all good things, there must come an end to it. It’s really hard for me to put a specific date and time on when I decided it was time for me to go back to school but let’s just say one day a switch just kind of flipped in my mind, that I needed to go back to school. When deciding in what to major in at the University of Hawaii. I saw that the school very recently started to offer Computer engineering as an option, and I was excited for that. I knew that the future of the world will always need computer engineers considering that we rely on it so heavily and I knew job security will always be there, so I enrolled and just kept my head down a rolled with the waves and here I am on my last year of school.<br /></p>
