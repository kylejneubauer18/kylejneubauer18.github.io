&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design patterns to a person who is outside the realm of software engineering would probably think that design patterns would probably have something to do with the design of a website in terms of aesthics. I know this because prior to learning about design patterns my initial thought to seeing design patterns, I thought the same thing. I thought ok so i'm gonna learn maybe, the proper way to organize a website in terms that there is a unwritten code on how to properly layout a landing page, navigation bar, footer menu, or how to layout each new page that displays on the clients end. I was a few minutes into my learning and I kept waiting for the introduction on the assumptions that I had made instead I kept learning that a design pattern turns out it isnt what I assummed it to be, to by jaw dropped surprised.
