## Design Pattens, It's Not What You Think
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design patterns to a person who is outside the realm of software engineering would probably think that design patterns would probably have something to do with the design of a website in terms of aesthics. I know this because prior to learning about design patterns my initial thought to seeing design patterns, I thought the same thing. I thought ok so i'm gonna learn maybe, the proper way to organize a website in terms that there is a unwritten code on how to properly layout a landing page, navigation bar, footer menu, or how to layout each new page that displays on the clients end. I was a few minutes into my learning and I kept waiting for the introduction on the assumptions that I had made instead I kept learning that a design pattern turns out it isnt what I assummed it to be, to by jaw dropped surprised.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, it turns out that design pattern in software engineering  is a general, repeatable  to a commonly occurring probelem in software design accordind to <a href="https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns">Source Making</a>. In other words design patterns is a description on how to solve a problem that can be used in different situations. Design pattern was initally initiated by four authors Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides in 1994 they published a book titled "Design Patterns-Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" and that is where the concept of design pattern started. In total there is about 23 known design patterns according to <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/design_pattern_overview.htm">Tutorials Point</a> considering there are many of them, today we'll just talk about the 4 most commonly used design patterns.
