Team Kanaloa is a team of student engineers from different disciplines(i.e. mechanical, electrical, civil, computer) and also ICS students in the Department of Computer Science and Informattion Technology. The team is spearheaded by Professor A Zachary Trimble who is an Associate Professor in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and has a student engineer lead that substitues for Professor Trimble in the event he is not available.

The main objective of Team Kanaloa is Maintain, upkeep, and update the teams unmanned marine vessel(pictured to the right). With maintaining the boat the team would replace parts as needed, such parts could include rivets that may have rusted over during sea trials or equipments that is no longer operational. In terms of upkeep, the team would occasionally run simulations on the unmanned vessal to see if all components are still in working order and in some instances the team would do a field test to see if the machine is still sea worthy. As funding becomes available or research has been done and has been found there is a more efficient way to complete the teams ultimate goal, the team would then update the vessal.

The Ultimate goal of Team Kanaloa is to comepete in the Robot X Challenge and Win. Winning the challenge would give the team the funding to further enchance the vessal and bring a vertain prestige to the school for winning the challenge. If you would like to know more about the Robot X Challenge you can find their website [here](https://robotx.org). The Robot X challenge is an international, university- level competition in which students from around the world will test their unmanned vessal capabilities. For example, the vessal would need to be able to navigate around on its own using GPS navigation, the vessal would then need to do a series of task as in weaving and navigating through buoys, sample challenge images can be seen below.

Being breifly apart of Team Kanaloa, I was teamed up with a fellow student engineer in the electrical engineering department. How task was to update the circuit diagram of the vessel and upload the diagram to a github repository. Each week the whole team would get together to talk about current status on our task and any new issues that may have risen during the previous week. Apart from the task of 

Vacay is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
