&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to integrate all the materials learned from software engineering, such materials learned and applied are Configuration Management, UI design using HTML, CSS, Semantic UI, React, creating databases using MongoDB, Application Design by way of Meteor, Agile Project Management, Deployment via digitalOcean, Testing with testcafe, and Javascript. The objective of the project is to build a user-friendly website in which a student or faculty of the University Of Hawaii at Manoa is able to quickly look up all available food options on campus through one website.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step in the project is figuring out what the problem is and coming up with a solution for that problem. For this project the problem is that there are currently too many food choices in and around the campus at manoa, in which there are many places to go to grab a bite to eat. However, what if the user wanted to eat a specific type of food, say, chinese, there is site in where a user is able to specifically filter through all the available options that is currently being offered that day, or another example, if a user wanted to eat greek food but its only available certain days or time of the week again there is no place a student/faculty would be able to quickly go to to check. The solution is Grub-N-Go, within the website the user is able to find specific menu items that are available that very day from different vendors around the campus and the website will be able to show the user when a specific food type will be available and display the menu.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the problem is known and a solution is presented the following step was to creatively exchange ideas on how the website would be built and what tasks needed to be done. Our team created an organization on github and used project boards to help with the task organization. The team also agreed to meet on specific days to exchange ideas and express concerns. Github was extensively used for version control, so the other team could and would be able to work on the master code without harming the original copy. Below are sample images of the github organization and project boards that were used to help keep the team on track and help with version control.
